`hyphenatr` : HYPHENATE ALL THE THINGS

At the moment, this requires <https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen> to be installed on the local system first. Am working to get it to ship with the package.

Support for extra hyphenation rules from <http://www.textcontrol.com/en_US/downloads/dictionaries/> coming soon.

The following functions are implemented:

-   `hyphenate` : hyphenate a vector of words, returning either a vector with hyphens (or specified strings) or a list of hypenated word components.
